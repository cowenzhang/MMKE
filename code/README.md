We present two unstructured text extraction models (RSO model and SRO model).

- RSO model divides RE task into three consecutive steps and starts with relation classification. The code of RSO model will coming soon.

- SRO model convert the RE task into a multi-turn question answering task. SRO model is similar to [our work](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/0546.pdf) which accepted by IJCAI 2020. The core code is available at [here](https://github.com/TanyaZhao/MRC4ERE.).
